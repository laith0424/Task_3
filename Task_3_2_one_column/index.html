                  <p>Innovative human - friendly dual arm robot with breakthrough functionality designed to unlock vast global additional automation potential in industry. YuMi® is designed for a new era of automation, for example in small parts assembly, where people and robots work side-by-side on the same tasks. Safety is built into the functionality of the robot itself. YuMi® removes the barriers to collaboration by making fencing and cages a thing of the past.</p>
                  <p>ABB’s growing family of YuMi robots is part of a suite of exciting collaborative automation solutions that help people and robots safely work closer together than every before possible.
                    ABB is adding a new member to the YuMi family, 7 axis YuMi, the smallest and most agile collaborative robot yet, making it easier than ever to put into production. The new 7 axis also opens up a world of flexible possibilities – for example a single-arm and a dual-arm YuMi could be combined to add a parts feed or inspection station to an assembly cell. Additionally, customer might want to have three or five YuMi arms in an application to improve the cycle time.</p>
                  <p>The entire YuMi family is designed to be easy to setup and use thanks to its intuitive lead through programming. That means that even people without specialized training or prior experience can successful use robots. Read more about Single-arm YuMi.</p>

                <h3>ABB robots help accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development in Thailand</h3>

                <p>As the world gears up to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid testing of vaccines is vital to ensure that populations can swiftly achieve immunity. Yet this testing must also be performed accurately to get the correct results and safely to ensure laboratory staff are not exposed to risk.</p>
                <p>With their ability to perform repeated actions accurately and quickly, robots are ideal for this type of work. Collaborative robots or cobots, which feature human like arms, are ideal to replace people in the testing of samples as they can perform the same manipulation and handling tasks accurately and tirelessly.</p>

                <p>Two ABB robots are part of an innovative AI-Immunizer system being used to help speed up the development of an effective vaccine that can be used to fight the spread of the COVID-19 virus in Thailand. Developed as part of a collaboration between the Faculty of Engineering at Thailand’s Mahidol University and the Institute of Molecular Biosciences, the system uses ABB’s IRB 1100 and YuMi® collaborative dual arm robots to assist with key tasks involved in vaccine testing and development.</p>
                <p>The AI-Immunizer conducts the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test or PRNT, a highly repetitive testing regime that causes stress and risk to human workers.</p>
                <p>The AI-Immunizer consists of two units – Unit A and Unit B. In Unit A, with its seven axes and two arms, YuMi handles the complete human immune neutralization testing process. Its human like arms and grippers allow it to work with standard laboratory tools and it is perfectly designed to perform the handling and picking tasks that humans are adept at. During this process, samples of the COVID -19 virus and different antibodies are mixed and tested before being analyzed with AI.</p>

              <p>Nucleic acid extraction begins with a technician loading the specimens to be tested. The IRB 1200 picks up the specimens and presents them to the barcode scanner to capture the data and ensure the measured results match with each specimen.  A custom-built machine then uncaps the specimens and extracts samples of ribo-nucleic acid (RNA) samples. Following this procedure, the IRB 1200 again picks up the specimens and places them in the second station.</p>  
              <p>After adding the reagents, the robot picks and places the specimens into a centrifuge, which ensures that no reagent residue is left, and that each specimen undergoes a perfect reaction. When this stage is complete, the robot picks and places specimens from the centrifuge to a conveyor to transport them to the third station.</p>

              <p>The flexible IRB 1200 can be mounted at any angle and comes with IP 40 protection as standard, with other protection standards available as options. The two robots used in the QVS-96S were supplied with the enhanced Clean Room option. of the food handling area. With its easy to clean smooth surface, this option eliminates the potential for contamination either of the robot or the samples.</p>
